Web app (stack: php,html,css)

a) Prompt the user for: user password (an employee’s EIN), user name, and
database, so as to create a connection to AW&H’s database. Your group’s
web application must allow the user to have a maximum of three attempts to
connect to database server – before allowing the user to proceed to the
solution for task b), a confirmation that the connection is successful must be
displayed to the user; if the connection is unsuccessful, after every three
attempts, your group’s web application must display an appropriate message.

b) Display the following as menu options, so as to let the user perform each task
upon successfully connecting to the AW&H’s database:

 Allow the user to send an email, to a specified email address, with their
selected employment details (excluding their password)
 Allow the user to select and execute from the following list of in-built
select queries:

 show their current BAN

 show the current branch for their bank

 give the total monies to be received for net pay (calculate this as:
salary – deductions)

 show their current highest qualification
 Allow the user to specify their own SQL query, which includes using
select and update queries upon the employees table. Ensure that the
intended record is correctly updated, whereby a confirmation is given to
the user; if the query is incomplete, an appropriate message must also be
displayed.
 Let the user exit the web application (the solution must request a
confirmation from the user before disconnecting from the database).
